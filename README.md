## Quickstart

Run `.\build.cmd init` or `.\build.sh init` to setup local environment.

## Build

The project is instrumented with common set of tasks implemented as targets via [Nuke.Build](https://nuke.build/). These can be invoked via entry point helper script `build.cmd` (or one of the other extensions based on terminal of choice).

`.\build.cmd <TARGET_NAME> --my-arg=<value>...`

Common targets:

- `init` - initializes git repo, sets up versioning, and restores necessary cli tools. Installs .NET SDK if it's missing
- `compile` - compile the project
- `publish` - .net publish the project, and package output into version stamped zip files into `artifacts` folder
-  `clean` - clear out `bin`,`obj`, and `artifacts` folders

Additional build targets can be easily added by editing `/build/Build.cs`

## Branching and Versioning

The code uses [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) for branching and release workflow.

Latest active branch developers commit to is `develop`, while `main` represents current production code. Release branches are created during stabilization phase, and represent next release being reading to be shipped to production. 

Versioning is derived from Git commit history using [Nerdbank.Gitversioning](https://github.com/dotnet/Nerdbank.GitVersioning). Current version can be obtained by running 

````
dotnet nbgv get-version
````

When the team is ready to start preparing next release, they *cut* a release branch from the `develop` branch. Release branch carries stabilization fixes for next release cycle, while `develop` increments next major version number and starts accumulating new features. 

Cutting a release branch can be done by issuing this command:

```
.\build.ps1 prepare-release
```

### Prereleases

Builds created out of different branches will have the pre-release tags applied automatically to their version numbers:

`develop`: `<semver>-alpha` 

`v.X.X`: `<semver>-beta` 

`main`: `<semver>`

any other: `<semver>-<short-sha>`

### Creating production release 

At the end of stabilization cycle when the release is made. The following steps should be performed:

- switch to release branch (ex. v2.0)
- edit `version.json` and change the `version` property to remove the `beta` tag
- commit
- merge release branch into master

## Config server

Config server allows configuration to be loaded from a dedicated service that is backed by one or more configuration sources. The default configuration source is git, allowing configuration changes to be stored in git, but loaded without having to redeploy the app.

![Config Server](https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/2-1/common/config-server/images/config-server-fig1.png)

The configuration is stored inside `/config` folder in the repository. You can launch config server locally via `docker-compose` from inside `services` folder vas following:

```
services> docker-compose up configserver
```
